    "\n",
    "2. **Use mutable data types:** If you use a mutable data type like a list or a dictionary, changes made inside the function will be reflected outside of it, because the function receives a reference to the original data, not a copy of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def check_condition(condition, result):\n",
    "    if condition:\n",
    "        result.append(\"The condition was True.\")\n",

    "my_result = []\n",
    "check_condition(True, my_result)\n",
    "print(my_result)  # prints: ['The condition was True.']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these methods has its pros and cons. Using global variables can make code harder to understand and debug, especially in larger programs, because it's not immediately clear where the variable is being changed. Using mutable data types can make your code more complex, especially if the function needs to change multiple values. In general, using `return` is the simplest and most straightforward way to get data out of a function."
